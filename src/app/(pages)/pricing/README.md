# Pricing Page Components

This directory contains the organized components for the pricing page. The main page has been separated into logical, reusable components for better maintainability and organization.

## Component Structure

### Main Page

- `page.tsx` - Main pricing page that imports and renders all components

### Components (Directly in pricing folder)

- `Hero.tsx` - Hero section with main intro text
- `PricingTable.tsx` - Pricing cards with features and pricing information
- `Testimonials.tsx` - Customer reviews section
- `CallToAction.tsx` - Call to action section with contact button

## Code Quality Improvements

### PricingTable Component

- **DRY Principle**: Replaced repetitive code with a clean map function
- **Data Structure**: Added unique IDs for better key management
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed incorrect feature mapping (was always showing first card's features)
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add/remove pricing cards

### Testimonials Component

- **Data Extraction**: Moved testimonial data to a constant array
- **Reusable Structure**: Easy to add/remove testimonials
- **Clean Mapping**: Uses map function for consistent rendering

### General Improvements

- **Removed Unused Imports**: Cleaned up unnecessary motion imports
- **Better Spacing**: Improved code readability with consistent spacing
- **Consistent Structure**: All components follow the same pattern

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Maintainability** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability** - Components can be easily reused in other parts of the application
3. **Readability** - Main page is now much cleaner and easier to understand
4. **Testing** - Individual components can be tested in isolation
5. **Collaboration** - Different team members can work on different components simultaneously
6. **Simple Structure** - All components are directly accessible in the pricing folder
7. **DRY Code** - No repetitive code, easy to maintain and update

## Usage

```tsx
import Hero from "./Hero";
import PricingTable from "./PricingTable";
import Testimonials from "./Testimonials";
import CallToAction from "./CallToAction";

// Use components individually or together
<Hero />
<PricingTable />
<Testimonials />
<CallToAction />
```

## Data Structure

- **Pricing Data**: Defined in `PricingTable` component with proper structure
- **Testimonials**: Extracted to a constant array for easy management
- **Future Enhancement**: Could be moved to separate data files or API endpoints
